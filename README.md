#### Description of app
This app is a study/work aid that will keep solutions and troubleshooting answers to coding problems in JS, HTML, Css, etc. It organized by category and has an area for a description/notes. It will have the ability to add new entries, update and delete entries.

#### Instructions
Click on any category to view all entries for that category. Click all to see all enteries.

From the index page a short description can be seen and a clickable link to a website/video that has the solution or lesson.

Each entry can be viewed, updated or deleted.  A new entry can be done by clicking the "New Entry" button at the top of the page.

## MVP
- As a user, I will be able to view all JS entries on the main page.
- As a user, I will be able to click on one entry and view the hyperlink, and description.
- As a user, I will be able to update the entry from that single view.
- As a user, I will be able to click the hyperlink and be redirected to that page from both the main page and the single view page.
- As a user, I will be able to go back to the main page from the single view page.
- As a user, I will be able to add a new entry of a description, a hyperlink, and a category from the main page.
- As a user, I want to be able to add my own solutions (no hyperlink needed).

## Difficulties
- General CSS/Bootstrap placement of items on page.
- Finalizing the "codeblock" feature.

## Future Additions
- Search function on main page.
- View videos from separate box within the page.
- Ablility to sort in ascending and descending order the Date created, title/name, etc.
- Ability to add new categories on the main page.
